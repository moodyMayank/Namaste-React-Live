### Why do we procastinate ?

- If the work is not affecting our present death / life , we usually delay that work and leave it for the next day.

- We dont set deadlines and hence move the work to next day.

#### Approach

1. Make Routine : keep following
2. Be Discipline : use it for new Stuff you do
3. Prioritization : You have limited time , prioritize work
