### Topics Discussed :-

- Library
- Framework
- Print : HTML

### Important Points :-

### Notes :-

- Framework is a full fledged tool , Example : Angular
- Example : Image Carousal is a js Library and It takes minimum effort to put and use a library.
- How does Browser gets to know what is document / createElement / getElementbyID : So this comes from the browser apis , browser has a JS Engine , browser knows about Window Object.
- CDN : Content Delivery Network
- We use React and ReactDOM CDN to use the inbuilt react code and print the Hello World.
- React CDN is giving us react functions to use , that is the fastest way to use react.
- React is made from javascript only made by facebook engineers
- React is a global Object when using CDN.
- ReactDOM { Print it Secret internals do not use or you will be fired }

- React is a global Object when using CDN
- ReactDOM { Print it Secret internals do not use or you will be fired }
- React - core library , ReactDOM - gives access to DOM of the Browser

- React is made from javascript only made by Facebook Engineers.
- Importing the CDN Links only is the shortest program of React because it gives us the React and ReactDOM Objects in the console which were not present previously.
- We can check by using React and ReactDOM in console like window.

---

- So therefore React is a global object like window.
- We inject 2 CDN links , React and ReactDOM :-
  - React : It is the Core library which we need to use react
  - ReactDOM : It is required to run Web based that requires the DOM Manipulation.
- Since we need react CDN in react native also , thats why React and ReactDOM are separated.

---

- Syntax of React.createElement();
- Syntax of ReactDOM.createRoot();
- React.createElement returns a object i.e. called ReactElement and then it is passed to RootElement through render method. Render method takes the react element and injects it inside the browser DOM.
