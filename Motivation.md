“Consistency is key to becoming a developer”.

Bullsh\*\*.

“Consistency is the key to success”.

Said the same people that are stuck at dead-end jobs for the last 20 years.

If you really want to succeed, you need to be obsessed, relentless, and willing to put in the hard work that others are too lazy to do.

Just look at Kobe Bryant -

He wasn't the best basketball player in the world because he was consistent.

He was the best because he was obsessed and worked harder than anyone else.

He was consistent but what he was really known for was being relentless and his obsession with improving his game.

Countless of his peers have spoken about how they struggled to keep up with him in practice, and how he was always the first one in the gym and the last one to leave.

So don't settle for just showing up and putting in the hours.

Push yourself to be better, to go above and beyond, and to be relentless in your pursuit of your goals.

That's the only way to truly reach the next level in your life.
